What effects the quality of water in Arizona and why?
Where do we get our drinking water in Arizona?
Other Ask?

Phoenix has three sources of water â€“ surface water (rivers and lakes), groundwater pumped from wells, and reclaimed water. These sources are used for agriculture, and industrial cooling and landscaping. 

Specific water sources of drinkable water: Rivers, Lakes, Well Water. 
For the purpose of this project we should just focus on sources of drinkable water. 

1.) A few sources of Well water quality
2.) Lakes
3.) Rivers


Since we have 3 people It might be cool for us each to analyze a specific source. 

Julie: Lakes
____:Rivers
____: Well Water

This way we can bring a robust and dynamic data set to the ask. 
 Discuss the variables, unique environmental considerations and basic quality level/standards etc. 

Be fully aware that this project does not have RIGHT answer it is informational in nature and can offer great insight for both us and the people we share it with. Most people are not aware of where their water comes from or how it is deemed safe to drink and why. 

The insights for these three different datasets will be different but they can be combined at the end and merged to create a little peak into answering the question What affects the quality of water in Arizona.
